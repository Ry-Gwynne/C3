				<li> The crown is a historical drama, that displays the life of british royals such as Late Queen Elizabeth II and her struggles during her reign.</li>
				<li> The cinematography and design of the show was also very beautiful and is one of the reasons why I watched the show. </li>
				<li> My favorite british royal is the late Princess Diana, the Queen of People's hearts.</li>
				<li> It also showed me that even royalties are not exempted to issues and challenges in life.</li>
