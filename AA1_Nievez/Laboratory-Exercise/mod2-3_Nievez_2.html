			<p>Umbrella Academy piqued my interest. I enjoyed how the storytelling drew you in as if you were a member of the umbrella academy. I really liked how it depicted exciting scenes; I was always on the edge of my seat. Umbrella Academy is my favorite television show; it made me laugh and cry, and it left an imprint on my heart by capturing my emotions.</p>
